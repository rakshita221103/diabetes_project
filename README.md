# DIABETES PREDICTION (LINEAR REGRESSION)
This diabetes prediction system will also be used with linear regression for factors such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level and show the chances of getting diabetes based on this analysis against historical data.It demonstrates practical applications of data science through Python, Pandas and Flask for web deployment.
# Datasets Columns:
## a)gender
## b)age
## c)hypertension
## d)heart_disease
## e)smoking_history
## f)bmi
## h)HbA1c_level
## i)blood_glucose_level
## j)diabetes
# Linear Regression:
The "Diabetes Prediction using Linear Regression" project applies linear regression as a statistical method to determine the relationship between a body of characteristics, such as age, BMI, blood glucose level, among others, and the risk of developing diabetes. The important objective of the study is to develop a model whereby a person, by personal characteristics and health metrics, can predict the probability of a person having diabetes. This predictive model will help in recognizing the population that may be more predisposed to diabetes and hence develop early interventions and preventive measures.
